# Magnetic-Control-Architecture
The goal is to create a general system for simulating the control of these bots with vector fields (in netlogo), and use a genetic algorithm to find a configuration that will generate a suitable magnetic field (in C++ and sped up with CUDA). You can find my blog about it on medium: medium.com/@nicholas.ehsan.roy
